After cloning run npm install
Run server with 'node server.js'


## Inspiration
It was something that we would use because we all have very busy schedules. This makes it challenging to coordinate an with even small groups of friends. Locus is our solution.
## What it does
Locus can look at you and your friends calendars and determine when all of you are free to meet up.
## How we built it
We built the webserver with node.js. The server acts as a front end for first time setup as well as serving the Alexa responses.
## Challenges we ran into
 * Learning new node.js libraries, express.js
 * Working with AWS and Alexa skills for the first time
 * Obtaining a signed ssl certificate so that swift and the Alexa skill can communicate
 * Domain.com banning our accounts instead of giving us a free domain
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
 * Having a working Alexa skill and service
## What we learned
 * How to create and train an Alexa skill
 * How to effectively use github as rvcs
 * Swift IOS development
 * MongoDB

## What's next for Locus
Flushing out more features
    * Integration with google calendar
    * More Alexa commands to add/modify events
